        # READ THIS BEFORE REPORTING A BUG

        Before reporting a bug, please make sure that the bug report has common sense and that a similiar one hasn't been reported yet by [searching the existing bug reports](https://github.com/sam065819/computer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+).

        If a similiar bug already exists, you may only reply if you would like to add any additional information.

        Please do not open a bug report if:
        - the bug you want to report already has been fixed in the bot
        - the bug you want to report has already been reported
        - the bug you want to report has been already noticed and is currently being fixed by the developer
        - a pull request was opened for it

        ## Required Information

        - A clear and concise description of the bug

        - A clear and concise description of the steps to reproduce the bug

        - Images or screenshots of the bug

        Skip formalities like "hello" and do not use AI for your bug reports.
        ## One bug per issue

        Do not include multiple bugs in one issue. If you are making 5 bug reports, make 5 different issues.
